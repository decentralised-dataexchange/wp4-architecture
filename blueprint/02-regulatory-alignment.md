# 2. Regulatory and Foundational Alignment

This section describes the regulatory foundations guiding the architecture design.

## 2.1 Normative References
(eIDAS, CIR, ARF, BW regulation draft)

### 2.1.1 Revocation Mandate
Our implementation of identity revocation is anchored in Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 (eIDAS 2.0). Article 5 of this regulation sets the non-negotiable legal baseline for personal identification data (PID) revocation. Similarly, the European Business Wallet (EBW) proposal extends these trust requirements to legal entities. These regulations ensure that when a identity is no longer valid or secure, it is removed from the ecosystem immediately

## 2.2 Architectural Principles
- Interoperability
- Reusability
- Security-by-design
- Privacy-by-design

## 2.3 Compliance Expectations
How the Blueprint ensures alignment without duplicating specifications.
